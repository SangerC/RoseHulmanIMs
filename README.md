### Customers

This app is for people who both attend and are employees of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. It's a replacement for an app that's otherwise outdated and/or has a terrible user interface. 

### Background for the Opportunity / Problem

When asked what they hated most about IMLeagues, Rose students had the following points to make most often:

1. Difficult to navigate, especially between mobile and desktop versions. Many students complained that it was difficult to find things between the webpages.
2. Every time an event occurs on the website (click, etc.) an ad blocks the screen.
3. Overall prescence of ads is annoying.

As an employee of Rose-Hulman's IMs, we often struggle with using IMLeagues during games. With the introduction of new rules and regulations because of COVID-19, it is important that we use a website that is reliable.
